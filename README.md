# cinema-weak-spot

This is the source code for the analysis I did in [this blog post][blog].

It investigates the difference in ratings of movies I watched in theaters and at home.

Download your `diary.csv` file from the [Letterboxd export page][data] and save on this folder. Remember to clean the tags appropriately, leaving only one tag for each movie. The tags can be _cine_ and _home_, for instance.

Then open the `cinema-weak-spot.ipynb` file in a `jupyter notebook`.
